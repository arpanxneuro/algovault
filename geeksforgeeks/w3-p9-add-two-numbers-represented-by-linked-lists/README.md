## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty singly linked lists representing two non-negative integers.  
Each node of the linked list contains a single digit. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, meaning the 1’s digit is at the head of the list.

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list — also in reverse order.  
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.

## 📥 Input

- `l1`: head of the first linked list (represents a non-negative integer in reverse order)
- `l2`: head of the second linked list (same representation)

---

## 📤 Output

- Return the head of a new linked list representing the sum of the two numbers, with digits stored in reverse order.

## ✅ Example

**Input**  
l1 = [2,4,3] # represents 342
l2 = [5,6,4] # represents 465
**Output**  
[7,0,8] # represents 807 (since 342 + 465 = 807)

**Explanation**

- 342 + 465 = 807
- The result list in reverse order of digits is 7 → 0 → 8

## 🛠️ Approach

A straightforward and standard solution:

1. Reverse both linked lists so that their heads represent the least significant digit (i.e. ones place).
2. Traverse both reversed lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition.
3. For each sum, create a new node whose value is `sum % 10`, update carry to `sum // 10`. Append node to result list.
4. If one list is longer — continue adding remaining digits plus carry.
5. If after processing both lists there is a leftover carry — create a new node for it.
6. Reverse the result list and return its head — now digits are back in reverse order representation.

This yields a correct sum representation, handles carry properly, and works for different-length inputs.

## ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n, m are lengths of the two lists (you traverse each at most once, plus reversals).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for the result list (plus O(1) auxiliary space if ignoring output storage).

## 📌 Notes & Edge Cases

- Works even when one list is longer than the other.
- Handles carry propagation properly (e.g. 9 + 9 → carry).
- Handles final carry by appending extra node.
- Works when inputs have leading zeros — but you may trim if needed (GfG mentions trimming leading zeros in some variants).
