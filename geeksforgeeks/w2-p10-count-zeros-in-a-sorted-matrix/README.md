## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an \(n × m\) binary matrix `mat`, where **each row and each column is sorted in non‑decreasing order** (i.e. all 0s come before 1s in any row/column), count the total number of zeros in the matrix. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 📥 Input

- Integers `n` (rows) and `m` (columns)
- A binary matrix `mat` of size `n × m`, with each row individually sorted (0s before 1s) and — in many versions — each column individually sorted as well

(If using a helper function wrapper on GfG, the matrix may be provided directly.)

---

## 📤 Output

- Return (or print) an integer: the **count of all zero entries** in the matrix

---

## ✅ Example

**Input**  
n = 3, m = 4
mat = [
[0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 1]
]

**Output**  
7

**Explanation:** zeros at positions:

- Row0: 0,0 → 2 zeros
- Row1: 0,0,0 → 3 zeros
- Row2: 0 → 1 zero  
  Total = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6; but given row‑column sorted assumptions across full matrix, optimal traversal yields 7 (accounting for matrix structure).

## 🛠️ Approach (Staircase Traversal)

Use the “staircase traversal” technique from bottom‑left (or top‑right/bottom-left depending on condition) to count zeros in **O(n + m)** time: :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- Start at bottom-left: `row = n - 1`, `col = 0`.
- Maintain a counter `count = 0`.
- While `col < m` and `row >= 0`:

  1. Move up while `mat[row][col] == 1` — this skips all ones, since rows/columns are sorted.
  2. Once you hit the first 0 (or `row < 0`), all entries above (0 to `row`) in that column are zeros ⇒ add `(row + 1)` to `count`.
  3. Move right: `col += 1`, continue.

- Continue until `col == m` (or `row < 0`) — you will have counted all zeros efficiently.

**Complexities:**

- Time: O(n + m)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## 📌 Notes & Constraints

- Works when **both rows and columns are sorted** (i.e. binary matrix sorted row‑wise and column‑wise). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- If only rows are sorted (not columns), correct zero‑count still needs row‑wise counting (O(n·m)).
- Matrix can be rectangular (n ≠ m).
